## ‚ú®Features
- **Component-based architecture**: Usual UI is built on React, leveraging its component-based approach for a modular and scalable design.
- **TypeScript support**: Components are written in TypeScript, ensuring type safety and enhancing developer experience with autocompletion and type checking.
- **TailwindCSS integration**: Utilizes TailwindCSS for rapid styling, allowing developers to easily customize the appearance of components.


## üíøInstallation | Usage
To install Usual UI in` your project, you can use either npm or yarn.

### Using npm:

```bash
npm install usual-ui
```

### Using yarn:

```bash
yarn add usual-ui
```

After installation, you can import and use the components in your project.

```jsx
import { Button, Text, Input, Box, Stack } from 'usual-ui';

// Use the components in your application
```

Additionally, you can use **Tailwindcss** styles by combining them with **Usual-UI** styles:
```jsx
<Text variant="outline" className="text-amber-700">Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit</Text>
```

The **Stack** component allows you to arrange child components in a row or column, depending on the selected argument:
```jsx
<Stack direction="row" gap="md" className="bg-gray-400">
	<Box variant="outline">First</Box>
	<Box variant="outline">Second</Box>
	<Box variant="outline">Third</Box>
</Stack>
```

</div>

In this library I have added **4 types of buttons**, you can change the style of the button using the "variant" attribute:
```jsx
<Button variant="solid">Solid</Button>
<Button variant="outline">Outline</Button>
<Button variant="ghost">Ghost</Button>
<Button variant="underline">Underline</Button>
```
